### 👋🏼 G'day world! 🌏

👤 I'm David Dolph aka David A. Symons.

Driven by a sincere passion for people, problem-solving, technology and engineering, my work spans a multitude of industries from global conglomerates in travel ([Expedia](https://expediagroup.com/)), connected cars ([Toyota](https://www.toyota.com/)), video games ([Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/)), to early-stage FinTech start-ups ([Open Banking](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/), [Banked](https://banked.com/)), scale-ups ([Dream11](https://www.dream11.com/)), and the world’s largest supermarket ([Tesco](https://www.tesco.com/)).

I have been an Operations, Systems, DevOps, and Platform Engineer. I've served as Lead, Head, Principal, VP, and CTO. I’ve founded and failed, built and scaled teams from 0→1, delivered across start-ups, scale-ups, enterprises and multinationals. From data centers to cloud, containers to Kubernetes, kaizen to customers — my focus has always been on delivering effective, efficient and excellence in engineering.

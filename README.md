### G'day world! 👋🏼

👋🏼 G'day! I'm David Dolph (David A. Symons).

I have a sincere passion for people, problem solving and technology.

I have worked across a multitude of industries, from global conglomerates ([Expedia](https://expediagroup.com/), [Toyota](https://www.toyota.com/), [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/)) to early-stage, startup and growth companies ([Open Banking](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/), [Banked](https://banked.com/), [Dream11](https://www.dream11.com/)).

I love helping companies (including seed, pre-seed, Series A-C) start, build and scale 🚀
